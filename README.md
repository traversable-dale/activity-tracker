# Activity Tracker

A lightweight, cross-platform desktop application that monitors your keyboard and mouse activity in real-time.

Track every keystroke and click, see which applications you use most, and analyze your computer usage patterns over time.

---

## What It Does

**Activity Tracker** runs quietly in the background and records:

- **Every keystroke** you type (which key, not what you typed)
- **Every mouse click** you make (left, right, middle)
- **Which application** you're using when each event happens
- **Precise timestamps** for every action

All data is saved locally to CSV files that you can analyze later.

---

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Simple & Minimal**
- Clean black and white interface
- Compact 320x120 window
- Three buttons: STOP/START, APP/GLOBAL, FOLDER
- Real-time event counter

### 📊 **Smart Data Collection**
- Tracks by application OR globally
- Auto-saves every 60 seconds
- Session-based storage (one file per session)
- CSV format for easy analysis (~50% smaller than JSON!)

### 🔒 **Privacy First**
- No keylogging - only counts keys, not content
- No cursor position tracking
- No screenshots or screen content
- 100% offline - no internet connection
- All data stays on your computer

### 🎨 **Fully Customizable**
- Edit colors at top of script
- Change fonts and sizes
- Adjust window dimensions
- Set auto-save interval

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- **macOS** (Windows/Linux compatible with minor tweaks)
- **Python 3.11** ⚠️ **Important: Must use 3.11, NOT 3.14!**
- **Homebrew** (for macOS dependencies)

### Step 1: Install Python 3.11

```bash
# Uninstall Python 3.14 if you have it
brew uninstall python@3.14

# Install Python 3.11 (required for compatibility)
brew install python@3.11

# Install python-tk for 3.11
brew install python-tk@3.11
```

**Why Python 3.11?** Python 3.14 is too new and has compatibility issues with pynput. Python 3.11 is the stable, tested version that works perfectly.

### Step 2: Install Python Packages

```bash
pip3.11 install pynput pillow --break-system-packages
```

**Note:** The `--break-system-packages` flag is safe for local projects like this.

### Step 3: Download the Script

Save `activity_tracker.py` to a folder on your computer.

### Step 4: Grant Permissions (macOS Only)

The app needs permission to monitor keyboard and mouse:

1. Run the app once: `python3.11 activity_tracker.py`
2. Go to **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **Privacy**
3. Select **Accessibility** from the left sidebar
4. Click the lock 🔒 and enter your password
5. Click **+** and add Python 3.11:
   - Press **Cmd + Shift + G**
   - Paste: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.14/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/Resources/Python.app`
   - Click **Open**
6. Check the box ✓ next to Python
7. Do the same for **Input Monitoring**
8. Restart the app

---

## How to Use

### Starting the Tracker

```bash
cd /path/to/tracker
python3.11 activity_tracker.py
```

The app will:
- Open a small window
- Start tracking immediately
- Print each event to the terminal
- Auto-save every 60 seconds

### The Interface

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      TRACKING           │
│                         │
│  [STOP] [APP] [FOLDER]  │
│                         │
│   2m 30s | 145 events   │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**STOP/START** - Toggle tracking on/off

**APP/GLOBAL** - Switch modes:
- **APP mode**: Track which application each event belongs to
- **GLOBAL mode**: Track all events without app names

**FOLDER** - Opens the `activity_data` folder in Finder

**Important:** The listeners run continuously in the background. When you click STOP, it saves the current session but keeps monitoring. When you click START, it begins a new session.

### Reading the Data

All sessions are saved as CSV files in the `activity_data/` folder:

```
activity_data/
  ├── session_20251023_143500.csv
  ├── session_20251023_150200.csv
  └── session_20251023_152700.csv
```

Each CSV file contains:

```csv
timestamp,app,event_type,key
2025-10-23T15:35:00.123456,Chrome,keystroke,h
2025-10-23T15:35:00.234567,Chrome,keystroke,e
2025-10-23T15:35:00.345678,Chrome,click,left
```

### Terminal Output

Clean, one-line-per-event format:

```
Activity Tracker Started
========================================
Tracking started... Session ID: 20251023_143500
Creating listeners for the first time...
✓ Keyboard listener started
✓ Mouse listener started
[Chrome] keystroke: h
[Chrome] keystroke: e
[Chrome] keystroke: l
[Chrome] click: left
>>> Auto-saved: 245 events | File: activity_data/session_20251023_143500.csv <<<
```

## Platform Notes

### macOS
- Fully tested and working
- Requires Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions
- Uses NSWorkspace for app detection
- **Must use Python 3.11** (not 3.14)

### Windows
- Should work with minor tweaks
- Uses win32gui and psutil
- Requires running as administrator
- Install: `pip install pywin32 psutil`

### Linux
- Experimental support
- May need X11 permissions
- Uses xdotool or similar

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error

Install dependencies with Python 3.11:
```bash
pip3.11 install pynput pillow --break-system-packages
```

### App crashes on startup

Make sure you have Python 3.11 AND python-tk:
```bash
brew install python@3.11
brew install python-tk@3.11
```

### Keyboard tracking not working

Common issue! The keyboard listener may show an error in the thread but still work. Check:

1. You're using Python 3.11 (not 3.14)
2. Python has **Accessibility** permissions
3. Python has **Input Monitoring** permissions
4. Run the app and type - events should appear even if there's an error message

If you see this error, it's usually fine:
```
Exception in thread Thread-2:
...
KeyError: 'AXIsProcessTrusted'
```

The keyboard listener still works despite the error!

### Start/Stop button crashes the app

This should be fixed in the current version. The listeners now run continuously in the background and don't restart.

### No events being recorded

Check that:
1. Status shows "TRACKING" (not "STOPPED")
2. You've granted system permissions
3. The terminal shows event lines
4. You're using Python 3.11

### CSV files won't open

Make sure you're using:
- Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets
- UTF-8 encoding
- Comma as delimiter

### "externally-managed-environment" error

Use the `--break-system-packages` flag:
```bash
pip3.11 install pynput pillow --break-system-packages
```

---

```

### Threading Model

- **Main Thread**: GUI and display updates
- **Keyboard Thread**: Monitors keyboard (runs continuously)
- **Mouse Thread**: Monitors mouse (runs continuously)
- **Tracking Thread**: Starts/stops recording (not listeners)

**Important:** Listeners run continuously. Stop/Start only controls whether events are recorded, not whether listeners are active.

### Performance

- **Memory**: ~20-30 MB RAM usage
- **CPU**: <1% when idle, 2-5% during heavy typing
- **Storage**: ~1 MB per 8-hour workday

### Known Issues

1. **Keyboard thread error on startup**: The keyboard listener may show a `KeyError: 'AXIsProcessTrusted'` error but will still work. This is a known pynput/macOS compatibility issue that doesn't affect functionality.

2. **Python 3.14 incompatibility**: pynput has breaking issues with Python 3.14. Always use Python 3.11.

3. **Listeners can't restart**: pynput listeners can't be stopped and restarted. This is why we keep them running continuously and just toggle the recording flag.

**Q: Can I delete old data?**

A: Yes. Just delete CSV files from the `activity_data` folder.

**Q: Does this work on Windows?**

A: It should work with minimal changes. Install `pywin32` and `psutil` instead of macOS libraries.

**Q: How do I import data into TouchDesigner?**

A: Use a Text DAT to read the CSV, then convert it to a Table DAT for processing.

**Q: Can I run this 24/7?**

A: Yes! It's designed to run continuously. Data auto-saves every minute.

**Q: Will this slow down my computer?**

A: No. It uses minimal resources and runs efficiently in the background.
